# CPSC481_Missionary_Cannibals

In this problem, three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, that the missionaries present on the bank cannot be outnumbered by cannibals. The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.

First let us consider that both the missionaries (M) and cannibals(C) are on the same side of the river.
Left Right
Initially the positions are : 3M , 3C (B) and 0M , 0C

MMM CCC (B) ~~~ 
MM CC ~~~~ M C (B)
MMM CC (B) ~~~~  C
MMM  ~~~~  CCC (B)
MMM C (B) ~~~~  CC
M C ~~~~ MM CC (B)
MM CC (B) ~~~~ M C
 CC ~~~~ MMM C (B)
 CCC (B) ~~~~ MMM 
 C ~~~~ MMM CC (B)
 CC (B) ~~~~ MMM C
  ~~~~ MMM CCC (B)
  
â€¢ Here (B) shows the position of the boat after the action is performed.
Therefore all the missionaries and cannibals have crossed the river safely.
